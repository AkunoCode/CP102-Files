# CP102 Programming Portfolio (A.Y 2022-2023)

This repository contains a compilation of programming activities done for the course Computer Programming 2 (CP102) in Manuel S. Enverga University Foundation as well as personal practice programs that I did as a supplement for learning. The programming language used for this course is Python. The course outcomes are listed below, and each outcome has a corresponding directory in this repository containing the programs created to achieve that outcome.

## Course Outcomes

1. Create Python program applying object-oriented programming (OOP).
2. Use regular expression to search pattern in a string.
3. Create a Python program that performs data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization.
4. Create Python program that performs create, retrieve, update, and delete (CRUD) operations in a database using Structured Query Language (SQL).
5. Create a Python program with graphical user interface (GUI).
